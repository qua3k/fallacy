# Fallacy

"fallacy bot good" â€“ a logician

## What this is:

This bot, I think, is better than mjolnir

## Features:

*   written in go which is supposed to be good
*   abuses goroutines to hog your system's resources
*   follows you everywhere you go (room upgrades)
*   tells users you dont want to hear them (mute users)
*   removes your shitposts (purges messages)
*   actually thanks users for coming (welcome messages)

## To-do:

*   automatically unmute users after a certain period of time

## Maybe:

*   restricting new users from a specific server for optional amount of time
*   mjolnir banlist support
*   messages pinning via reply
*   sllow mode via redacting messages if last one was sent in X time ago
    *   must evaluate the feasibility of this
*   adjust power levels
    *   promote/demote users
*   banning w/ reason + post to ban list
*   kicking w/ reason
*   kicking/banning certain display/usernames
*   emit m.room.retentions

**Warnings are useless and I don't want them**
